# **Identifying issues in the development process and consolidating solutions**

## **ECS**
* Defining hierarchical relationships between `Entity` and implementing semantics based on names
* 

## **RendererSystem**
* ~~Accurately extracting OpenGL buffers such as VAO and VBO from `MeshComponent` and coordinating `ModelData`~~(2025/04/26)
    * The solution is to add a for loop and handle intermediate data.
* Implementing Texture Shader and Rendering Pipeline
* Lighting shader and drawing pipeline implementation
* Implementing camera movement and rotation

## **3D Animation**
* implementing Mixamo animation playback function

## **Game Objects(Actor)**
* Considering the architecture for easily creating Actor object classes
* 

## **System**
* Implementing a Texture Importer
* Implementing load log acquisition and display functions
*
